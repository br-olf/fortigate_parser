# A toolkit to migrate from a fortigate firewall to OPNsense
This toolset is still in development and can't be used _now_. 
However if you want to help it will be usable faser ;)


## Contents:
* A LARK parser grammar for the fortigate configuration language
* An "interpreter"(`fortigate_extractor`) that extracts the usefull information from the parse tree and exports it into a intermediate JSON representation
* A tool to patch an existing OPNsense `config.xml` with the contests of the JSON exports generated by `fortigate_extractor`
* A pretty print module to make fortigate configs more human readable
